Insurance Analysis Project - Week 3

Project Description

This project involves analyzing an insurance dataset using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques. The goal is to extract insights, perform statistical analysis, and understand relationships between variables such as insurance premiums, claims, and customer demographics. The analysis will be hosted on GitHub, using Git for version control and GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

Technologies Used
Python: Main programming language for the project
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
NumPy: For numerical computations
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating data visualizations
Scikit-learn: For statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms
Streamlit: For building interactive data web apps
Git: For version control
GitHub Actions: For Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD)
